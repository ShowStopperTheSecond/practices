// JavaScript’s primary numeric type, Number, is used to represent integers and to
// approximate real numbers. JavaScript represents numbers using the 64-bit floating-
// point format defined by the IEEE 754 standard,1 which means it can represent num‐
// bers as large as ±1.7976931348623157 × 10308 and as small as ±5 × 10−324.
// The JavaScript number format allows you to exactly represent all integers between

// integer values larger than this, you may lose precision in the trailing digits. Note,
// however, that certain operations in JavaScript (such as array indexing and the bitwise
